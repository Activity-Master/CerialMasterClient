# AI Assistant Workspace Rules

1. **Behavioral & Technical anchors**: Always obey sections 4 and 5 of `rules/RULES.md` (language tone, transparency, and the technical commitments).
2. **Document Modularity**: The Document Modularity Policy lives in `rules/RULES.md` (search for "Document Modularity Policy"); break large docs into topic files and link to indexes.
3. **Forward-Only**: Section 6 of `rules/RULES.md` explains the forward-only requirement—no legacy anchors, no backward-compatible shims.
4. **Prompt Reference**: Load `docs/PROMPT_REFERENCE.md` to understand selected stacks (Java 25, GuicedEE client, ActivityMaster Cerial Client rules) and glossary precedence before generating further artifacts.
5. **Stage Gates**: Use the PACT/GUIDES/IMPLEMENTATION loop described in `PACT.md` and `RULES.md` when describing work; mention the blanket approval state when responding after each stage.
6. **Rules anchor**: Treat `rules/generative/data/activity-master/cerial-client` as the topic index for this library and register the Mermaid MCP server from `.mcp.json` before editing diagrams.
